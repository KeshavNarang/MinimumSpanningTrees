# MinimumSpanningTrees
Minimum Spanning Trees strive to connect N nodes with N-1 edges such that the total edge weight is minimized. I demonstrate how two algorithms (Prim's and Kruskal's) construct an MST and also provide code in Java showing how MSTs can be used on a large scale for cable companies.
